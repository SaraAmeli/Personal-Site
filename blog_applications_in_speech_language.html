        <h2>1. Speech Recognition</h2>
        <p>Speech recognition systems convert spoken language into written text, enabling hands-free interaction with computers and other devices. Modern speech recognition models, such as deep learning-based systems, have revolutionized this field by achieving high accuracy even in noisy environments.</p>
        <p>Key applications of speech recognition include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Voice Assistants:</strong> Virtual assistants like Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Apple's Siri rely on speech recognition to interpret voice commands and respond appropriately.</li>
            <li><strong>Transcription Services:</strong> Automatic transcription tools are widely used in media, healthcare, and education to convert speech into text, saving time and effort in manual transcription.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Support Systems:</strong> Many businesses use automated phone systems powered by speech recognition to understand and respond to customer queries efficiently.</li>

        <h2>2. Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech Synthesis</h2>
        <p>Text-to-speech (TTS) systems convert written text into natural-sounding speech, enabling machines to "speak" to users. These systems use deep neural networks to generate high-quality, human-like speech, which is useful in a wide range of applications.</p>
        <p>Common uses of TTS include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> TTS systems help people with visual impairments or reading disabilities by converting written content, such as books, websites, and documents, into speech.</li>
            <li><strong>Navigation Systems:</strong> GPS navigation systems use TTS to provide turn-by-turn directions to drivers, making navigation more intuitive.</li>
            <li><strong>Virtual Assistants:</strong> TTS is an essential component of virtual assistants, enabling them to respond to users in a natural, conversational manner.</li>

        <h2>3. Machine Translation</h2>
        <p>Machine translation (MT) refers to the automatic translation of text from one language to another. Advances in neural machine translation (NMT), driven by deep learning, have dramatically improved the accuracy and fluency of translations.</p>
        <p>Applications of machine translation include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Global Communication:</strong> Tools like Google Translate help people communicate across language barriers, facilitating international travel, business, and diplomacy.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Localization:</strong> Companies use MT to translate their websites, software, and marketing materials for different regions and languages, expanding their global reach.</li>
            <li><strong>Language Learning:</strong> MT can assist language learners by providing instant translations and explanations of new words and phrases.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Sentiment Analysis</h2>
        <p>Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment or emotional tone behind a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral. This is achieved through natural language processing techniques combined with machine learning algorithms.</p>
        <p>Applications of sentiment analysis include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Social Media Monitoring:</strong> Businesses use sentiment analysis to track public opinion about their products, services, or brand on platforms like Twitter and Facebook.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Feedback Analysis:</strong> Sentiment analysis helps companies analyze customer reviews and feedback to understand satisfaction levels and improve their offerings.</li>
            <li><strong>Political Analysis:</strong> Sentiment analysis is used in political campaigns and media to understand public sentiment around key issues or candidates.</li>

        Efficient Conformer: Progressive Downsampling and Grouped Attention for Automatic Speech Recognition

        Transformer models are good at capturing content-based global interactions, while CNNs exploit local features effectively. In this work, we achieve the best of both worlds by studying how to combine convolution neural networks and transformers to model both local and global dependencies of an audio sequence in a parameter-efficient way.
