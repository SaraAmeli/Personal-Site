          High Fidelity Neural Audio Compression
        </a>
      </strong><br>
      This paper showcases <em>EnCodec</em>, a real-time, high-fidelity neural audio codec with a streaming encoder–decoder and quantized latent space. It uses multiscale adversarial training and introduces a novel “loss balancer” mechanism to stabilize training. Additionally, lightweight Transformer models further compress representations by up to 40% while remaining faster than real-time.

          Jukebox: A Generative Model for Music
        </a>
      </strong><br>
      OpenAI’s <em>Jukebox</em> tackles the challenge of generating raw audio music (including singing) with coherent structure across multiple minutes. It leverages a multi-scale VQ‑VAE for discretizing audio and autoregressive Transformers to model long-range dependencies, enabling controllable generation (by artist, genre, lyrics).

          Neural Audio Synthesis of Musical Notes with WaveNet Autoencoders
        </a>
      </strong><br>
      This WaveNet-style autoencoder learns temporal codes from raw audio and uses them to synthesize musical notes. Coupled with the NSynth dataset, it allows timbral interpolation and morphing between instruments, demonstrating expressive and high-quality novel sound generation.

          SoundStream: An End-to-End Neural Audio Codec
        </a>
      </strong><br>
      <em>SoundStream</em> introduces an efficient end-to-end neural codec capable of compressing speech, music, and general audio across variable bitrates (3–18 kbps) with minimal quality loss. It combines a convolutional encoder–decoder with residual vector quantization and supports real-time processing and noise suppression.

          WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio
        </a>
      </strong><br>
      The seminal <em>WaveNet</em> architecture models raw audio waveforms via an autoregressive, dilated convolutional neural network. It achieves state-of-the-art speech quality in TTS and generalizes to other audio modalities, laying the foundation for later developments like NSynth and neural audio synthesis.
