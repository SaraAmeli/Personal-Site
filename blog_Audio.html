        Efficient Conformer: Progressive Downsampling and Grouped Attention for Automatic Speech Recognition        
      </a>
    </strong><br>
    Burchi, Maxime; Vielzeuf, Valentin. (2021).<br>
    In <em>Proceedings of the 2021 IEEE Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Workshop (ASRU)</em>, pp. 8–15. IEEE.

    Transformer models are good at capturing content-based global interactions, while CNNs exploit local features effectively. To achieve the best of both worlds, by studying how to combine convolution neural networks and transformers, they introduce a convolution-augmented transformer for speech recognition to model both local and global dependencies of an audio sequence in a parameter-efficient way.
